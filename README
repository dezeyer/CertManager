Let's manage certificates from one place, trought a simple web gui

if i get this composer things, the adminlte and smarty libs will be removed.

Download and move into your webroot, make sure your webserver has write access to the upper directory, where the
certificate folder will be created. Paths can be changed in config.php. Don't forget to set a cronjob, as described in
the dashboard (soon).

feel free to make your own of this shit, i never found a solution like this that isn't integrated in an webspace
management like vesta eg., so i created my own.
